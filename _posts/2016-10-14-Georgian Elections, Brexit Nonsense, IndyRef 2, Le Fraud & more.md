Previously in Europe, Le Fraud! This week we discuss the recent Georgian elections, how their political parties work and operate as well as how pretty their alphabet is. We also discuss this week's brexit nonsense, how the UK, Scotland and Ireland are preparing for the fallout. Finally we touch on French campaign financing fraud, icy Franco-Russian relations, Erdogan appealing German court cases and the Hungarian press.
