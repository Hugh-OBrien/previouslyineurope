title: Wilders Stops Campaigning, Munich Defence Conference, Montenegrin Coup Attempt  & Mystery Radiation
---

Previously in Europe, a debating Wilders. This week we discuss the events surrounding last weekend's Munich defence conference, American VP Micheal Pence's comments and Europe's reaction to them. Then we went on a slight fear-mongering rant and landed on mystery radiation. Also we discuss Wilder's current campaign, or lack there of, and whether there is actually a merit to what he is doing.
