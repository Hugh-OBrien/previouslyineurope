title: Dutch General Election Results, ECJ Ruling on Religious Symbol Workplace Ban & Rome Summit.
---

Previously in Europe, Hugh. This week it's just me, Kieran/Ciar√°n (who knows with my name anymore) Hugh is on holiday so I try to cover the Dutch election results and what it all means. I also cover how the press was slightly misleading about the ECJ's ruling on workplace bans of religious symbols and the ultimately uneventful Rome Summit.
