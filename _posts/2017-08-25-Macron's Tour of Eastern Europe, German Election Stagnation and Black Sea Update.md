Previously in Europe, reparations. This week on the podcast we discuss Macron's tour of Eastern Europe, with a pretty obvious macro EU political agenda... Additionally we try to discuss the bore that is the German election. We talk also about some countries that happen to be on the Black Sea - Ukraine and Romania with their completely otherwise unrelated recent news.
