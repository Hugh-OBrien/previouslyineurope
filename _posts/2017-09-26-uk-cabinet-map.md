A reasonably common theme in UK politics of late is the dominance of parties other than the Conservatives in cities, and the blue belt dominating the rural areas (in England at least). This rural/urban divide isn't unique to the UK by any means. The US has a similar right means rural and left means urban issue. Romania is another good example as we saw large scale protests in cities against attempted reforms by the current government... also just look at the [geographical divide in their presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_presidential_election,_2014).

I was curious how these sorts of geographical divides translated into governing power within ruling governments. Originally I wanted to look at France but their system means those entering government leave their seats in parliament. Which is actually a good way to combat potential biases towards your local issues. In the UK however you do end up with sitting members of parliament also being appointed ministers (with the exception of one House of Lords member in the current cabinet). Those attending cabinet meetings arguably have a disproportional voice compared to any regular MP even in the ruling party. We know the conservatives are in government but within the party what regional biases exist?

This is by no means a definitive analysis of anything but an interesting visualisation. Below is a constituency map of the UK for the last general election and those at cabinet meetings displayed. Unsurprisingly Scotland is mostly a graveyard since it's still largely controlled by the Scottish National Party. The notable thing from it is the absence of any mass of MPs from large cities. The denser the constituencies get, the less cabinet members appear.

Now we know that the conservatives don't tend to get many seats in metropolitan areas; however when you look at the map it's all the more clear - top level decisions in the UK are made in London, but by those representing rural and commuter areas in England. Centres of big cities like Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds lack cabinet ministers. Northern Ireland isn't even home to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (at least Scotland and Wales have theirs). If this isn't a argument for a federalised system in the UK I don't know what is...
