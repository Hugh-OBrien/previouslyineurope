title: "Catalan Sort of Declares Independence and Austrian Election"

Previously in Europe Nigel Farage's gravy train. This week we return to discussing the ongoing events in Catalan surrounding their independence referendum. We also discuss the upcoming Austrian election and their probable right wing coalition. There's a bunch of other stuff discussed but nothing that makes the title or this description.
