Previously in Europe, an uncompromised Alex Salmond. This week we discuss the alleged return of Silvio Berlusconi, UK international development secretary's exit, Le Pen is stripped of immunity again and Alex Salmond's odd choice of home for his new talk show... Poland's independence day has some unfortunate white supremacy overtones and Catalonia is still a thing.
