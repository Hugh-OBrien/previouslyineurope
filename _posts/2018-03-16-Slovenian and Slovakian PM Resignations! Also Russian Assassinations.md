Previously in Europe,  Prime Ministers. This week we discuss the ongoing corruption scandal rocking Slovakia with multiple resignations this week. Slovenia's prime minister also resigned but for far less interesting reasons. Russia probably assassinated an ex KGB agent and his fianc√©e in the UK which has gotten everyone a bit angry, thought maybe not with the right people, who knows. Le Pen thinks we'll forget about the FN's terrible past if they change their name... which well maybe some people will...
