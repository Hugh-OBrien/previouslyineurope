Previously in Europe, extradition treaties. Do people remember "Are You Afraid of the Dark?" does that reference scan? Anyway, on this episode, we discuss the sexuality of some Russian assassins, some idiots who don't know that Starship Troopers is a cautionary tale about Fascism and more importantly our topic is how real is the rise of the far-right. Fun stuff!
