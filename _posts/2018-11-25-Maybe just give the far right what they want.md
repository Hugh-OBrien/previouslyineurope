# Show Notes:

## Nonsense Section
### Ireland thinks Poland's courts are okay I guess
After we discussed how they were potentially not going to send him back to Poland... they have ([euobserver.com](https://euobserver.com/tickers/143429) )The ECJ basically said they need to decide on a case by case basis. The Irish high court decided it's okay in this case ([www.thejournal.ie](https://www.thejournal.ie/poland-extradition-4346908-Nov2018/) )"It is important to state that it is the courts in Poland and, perhaps if he were to be convicted and have that conviction upheld on appeal, the European Court of Human Rights, that will have to decide whether any trial of this respondent (Mr Celmer) actually meets the Polish and ECHR standards respectively of right to a fair trial before an independent and impartial judiciary." His lawyers are planning to appeal from the sounds of it but this is possibly the beginning of the end for Poland's judicial wranglings with the EU ([www.eurotopics.net](https://www.eurotopics.net/en/210406/poland-suspends-forced-retirement-of-judges), )though pro government news outlets seem to think this is just a minor setback for their "reforms"

### Brexit Dealz?
So there's been a Brexit deal approved by the EU! So... Well nothings happened because the UK parliament may vote against it. We don't know when the vote will be ([inews.co.uk](https://inews.co.uk/news/brexit/brexit-deal-when-parliament-vote-theresa-may-draft-agreement/) )The deal has a lot of concessions for the UK but also the EU... the backstop for the Northern Ireland border is probably the most interesting bit ([www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/nov/25/may-brexit-deal-explained-eu-withdrawal-agreement-trade-backstop-citizens-rights) )Whether she'll have to face a no confidence vote is still up in the air because the process for calling one is a secret letter from MPs based system...

### AfD is in trouble
[www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/13/afd-co-leader-faces-calls-to-resign-over-campaign-donations)

Alice Weidel’s (AfD Co-leader) office received €130,000 from non-EU donor before last year’s election

Alice Weidel’s office near Lake Constance, in southern Germany, received a total of €130,000 (£110,000) in individual payments of 9,000 Swiss francs between July and September 2017.

She tried to return the money but returned €8000 - [www.dw.com](https://www.dw.com/en/afd-donor-scandal-weidel-under-official-investigation/a-46384979?maca=en-rss-en-all-1573-rdf)

## Topic 1
### Hilary is wrong and bad


**The garbage opinion piece that broke twitter**

Or maybe more specifically like *my* twitter: [www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/22/hillary-clinton-europe-must-curb-immigration-stop-populists-trump-brexit)

*Hillary Clinton: Europe must curb immigration to stop rightwing populists*

"Europe must get a handle on immigration to combat a growing threat from rightwing populists, Hillary Clinton has said, calling on the continent’s leaders to send out a stronger signal showing they are “not going to be able to continue to provide refuge and support”."

**Europe's pretty fuckin' brutal to migrants as it is**

[www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/nov/14/didnt-give-a-damn-refugees-film-croatian-police-brutality-bosnia)

"As screams ring out through the cold night air, Sami, hidden behind bushes, begins to film what he can.

“The Croatian police are torturing them. They are breaking people’s bones,’’ Sami whispers into his mobile phone, as the dull thumps of truncheons are heard."
