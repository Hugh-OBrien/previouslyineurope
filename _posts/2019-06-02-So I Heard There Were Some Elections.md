### Lithuanian presidential election


**Russia-critical banker elected president of Lithuania**

A former central banker, and political independent, Gitanas Nauseda won Lithuania's presidential election on Sunday against centre-right former finance minister, Ingrida Simonyte, in the second round of the elections. Nauseda will replace president Dalia Grybauskaite, often dubbed the Baltic nation's 'Iron Lady'. She could not run again after two terms in the post. Nauseda has pledged to maintain Grybauskaite's strict tone toward Russia.

### Spanish Local and Regional Election
Regional Elections, Spain is basically a federation 12/17 regions elected their parliament - The PSOE and Cs are up is the story there in 9 of 12 regions (Aragon, Asturias, Baeleric Isles, Cantabria, Canaries, Castile & Leon, Castille & La Mancha, Extremadura and Murcia) - The PSOE also made gains La Rioja (C’s held) and Navarre (C’s not present) and the C’s gained in Madrid while PSOE held - The PP and Podemos fell in 9 of 12 parliaments as well (Aragon, Asturias, Baeleric Isles, Canaries, Castille & Leon, Extremadura, La Rioja, Madrid and Murcia) - The PP was also down in Cantabria, Castile & La Mancha, making for a total of 11 of 12 (they don’t run in Navarre cuz Basque) - Podemos was kicked from Cantabria and Castile & La Mancha and also fell in Navarre (they lost seats in all 12 parliaments) - Vox got into 7 of the 12 parliaments (Aragon, Asturias, Baeleric Islands, Cantabria, Castile & Leon, Madrid and Murcia) out of the remaining 5 parliaments, they were next to receive seats in 4 of them (La Rioja is the exception) - Más Madrid is also a thing now, they split from Podemos. Juries still out on them. Local Elections - Same as Regional, PSOE up, Cs up, PP down, Podemos down - The Mas Madrid/Podemos split cost the left-wing control of Madrid and left-wing control of Zaragoza and Barcelona are also in question now (Ada Colau of Barcelona Mayor fame was super-cool god damn it)
