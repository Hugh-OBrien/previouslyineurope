<p>Where is the von der Leyen Commission?

The latter not being a great sign for von der Leyen in general...</p><p>Who's replacing her?</p><p>Thierry Breton, french business guy and former minister under Chirac. There are two pretty clear problems:</p><ul><li>MEPs are weary over his conflict of interest possibility being on a shit load of boards he's now resigned from</li><li>He says he'll stay out of discussions directly effecting his old company (Atos) but isn't clear on regulatory policy which affects it</li><li>He's supposed to still get Goulard's immense portfolio</li></ul><p><a href="[www.politico.eu](https://www.politico.eu/article/thierry-breton-pledges-to-avoid-conflicts-of-interest-in-financial-declaration/">https://www.politico.eu/article/thierry-breton-pledges-to-avoid-conflicts-of-interest-in-financial-declaration/</a></p><h3>And?</h3><p>Well )the S&D are pissed because now not only do they not have the presidency they were expected to get with Timmermans but due to Romania they're another commissioner down... also the balance of power has not swung in their favour with the actual portfolios.</p><p>Might it not get approved?</p><p>I mean there's a real chance... there'll be calls for pragmatism to keep things moving so it will likely get approved. Either way the S&D should never have accepted von der Leyen. It's not panning out well.</p><p>The delay is so far until December 1 but may go on longer as many of the issues involving the approvals have not been resolved...</p><p>Oh also:</p><ul><li>Estonia doesn't currently have a commissioner, neither does Romania because they both became MEPs...
