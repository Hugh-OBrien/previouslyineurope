## No Election Left Behind

### Spanish Elections

### Just keep repeating "Sanchez is weak on Catalonia"

The narrative from the C's consistently since April's election was that Sanchez wasn't to be trusted with not allowing Catalonia a real referendum and I don't know... beating the already imprisoned leaders? Hunting down the rest harder..?

Everyone on the right jumped on board during the debate. Vox claimed it was a coup...

Meanwhile 350k people protested in Barcelona for independence during the King's visit... so that's cool

### Didn't we just do this?

Yes! Sanchez was being congratulated at his immense victory in April:

### So how's that going now?

Well... Vox is now a going concern with a substantial number of seats and has very much been normalised

### Is there... good news?

Yes! There's apparently going to be a government!
