Civil service workers get their last job used to calculate their pension partly to encourage people to work in it (at lower pay than the private sector)</p></li><li><p>The points system is not transparent - the value of the points will get calculated by the state at the end and therefore it won't be transparent in the same way as basing it on salary would be (<a href="[www.dw.com](https://www.dw.com/en/france-unveils-controversial-pension-reforms/a-51617322">https://www.dw.com/en/france-unveils-controversial-pension-reforms/a-51617322</a>)</p></li><li><p>They )were also proposing the threshold of your income that would get you points would decrease - decreasing the whole pot</p></li></ul><h3>So like that doesn't sound good...</h3><p>A lot of the fear from the unions (and the public generally) is around the details of this reform, not the refusal for any reform. Polling from the start of the year said only 25% of people think the reforms are okay the way they are. The strikes have pretty good approval numbers... but other polling shows that people broadly want some sort of pension reform (<a href="[www.lefigaro.fr](https://www.lefigaro.fr/politique/retraites-malgre-un-recul-le-soutien-des-francais-a-la-greve-reste-majoritaire-20200103">https://www.lefigaro.fr/politique/retraites-malgre-un-recul-le-soutien-des-francais-a-la-greve-reste-majoritaire-20200103</a>)</p><p>The )centralised points system on these terms would wipe out most special cases unions have fought for. This is a short term fix that would help balance the countries books.</p><p>Unions such as the teacher's union would very easily be able to make the argument nobody would become a teacher at their bad salaries in France if the pensions were also bad.</p><p>The train unions could see this as a mechanism to make train privatisation easier.</p><hr /><p>The general point is that Macron is trying to get filling the pension shortfall that the government now covers as part of its budget off the books. They're pretending it's to be more fair but its mostly about removing any subsidy from the state to cover public service (and some other things like the arts) gaps between contributions and payouts.</p><p>You'll see in most media coverage the report from COR, an independent pension advisory committee, who forecast the deficit in the system would be 0.7% of gdp by 2025 if there is no reform - making this sound urgent.</p><p>France24 points out this is only one of their forecasts and another of their scenarios shows it shrinking to 0.2% - the big difference in the forecasts is made up largely from expecting the state to cut some of the subsidies to the system... so the government will stop covering parts of the shortfalls that exist to make it look like the shortfalls get bigger when actually they would shrink if they changed nothing.
