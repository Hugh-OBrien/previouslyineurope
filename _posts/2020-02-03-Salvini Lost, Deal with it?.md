We get it, we don't like Salvini either so their movement is a good thing, but its hard to see the affect its having other than slowing the tide and preventing a major upset in one of the left's strongholds.  </p><p><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/italy-s-sardines-movement-presents-ethical-counter-to-far-right/a-52152079?maca=en-rss-en-all-1573-rdf">https://www.dw.com/en/italy-s-sardines-movement-presents-ethical-counter-to-far-right/a-52152079?maca=en-rss-en-all-1573-rdf</a></p><p>## 5* collapse  </p><p>So di Maio is out as leader and the party has collapsed electorally... so an early election is probable regardless of Salvini sweeping local elections<br /><a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/luigi-di-maio-end-of-italy-5star-movement/">https://www.politico.eu/article/luigi-di-maio-end-of-italy-5star-movement/</a></p><p>### Salvini lost apparently  </p><p>There were two regional elections where Salvini's coalition of parties won one and gained 11% in another but didn't win... the worry was he'd win the Emilia-Romagna one too, which would be wild because it's been won by huge margins usually by left or communist parties in recent memory:  </p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020%5C_Emilia-Romagna%5C_regional%5C_election">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020\_Emilia-Romagna\_regional\_election</a><br />- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014%5C_Emilia-Romagna%5C_regional%5C_election">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014\_Emilia-Romagna\_regional\_election</a> (20point lead)<br />- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010%5C_Emilia-Romagna%5C_regional%5C_election">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010\_Emilia-Romagna\_regional\_election</a> (~16 point)<br />- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005%5C_Emilia-Romagna%5C_regional%5C_election">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005\_Emilia-Romagna\_regional\_election</a> (27 point)  </p><p>it goes on like that going back very far.  </p><p>So his alliance lost by about 7%, with a dramatically increased turnout (29% up) and the 5* were wiped out completely. So he lost somewhere he shouldn't have been even competing? Doesn't sound like what the Economist called, "another blunder"  </p><p><a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2020/01/30/regional-elections-in-italy-buttress-the-government">https://www.economist.com/europe/2020/01/30/regional-elections-in-italy-buttress-the-government</a>  </p><p>Sure Salvini was bigging it up but it feels more like a sense of _if_ this were to have gone his way it would be a very convincing argument that there should be an election immediately. Him not winning but increasing his share plus no change nationally doesn't really sell his loss too much</p><p>------</p>
