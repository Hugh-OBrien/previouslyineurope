<p>This week in quarantine land we discuss the elections that have been postponed and those (looking at you Poland) that are bafflingly going ahead!</p><p><a href="https://www.patreon.com/previouslyineurope">Support us on Patreon!</a></p><p><a href="https://www.teepublic.com/user/previneurope">WE HAVE A T-PUBLIC STORE</a> what a fashionable way to support our podcast</p><p>We now have a website that you can find <a href="http://previouslyineurope.eu/">here!</a></p><p>Feel free to send us an email at <a href="https://previouslyineurope@gmail.com">PreviouslyInEurope@gmail.com</a> or follow us on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/PrevInEurope">@PrevInEurope</a></p><p>If you can please leave us a review on Apple Podcasts and if you can't do that tell a friend, this stuff really helps us out</p><p>Also, have you considered Matteo Renzi?</p><h2>No Election Left Behind</h2><h3>... But maybe delay them?</h3><h2>Poland</h2><p>After much fucking around they've settled on postal only voting... which ehh.. sure. The PiS are worried their mismanagement of the health service will be a bad look for them and might affect Duda's re-election chances.</p><ul><li><p>Initially they said some of it by post (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/polish-government-still-planning-to-hold-presidential-election#maincontent">https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/polish-government-still-planning-to-hold-presidential-election#maincontent</a>)</p></li><li><p>Now they're saying all of it by post (<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-52199897">https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-52199897</a>)</p></li></ul><p>But some problems with that:</p><ul><li><p>Poland has never had a postal election and they only have a month to arrange one (queue alarm bells ringing about fraud/mistakes)</p></li><li><p>Collecting millions of ballots and counting them by hand via thousands of election districts (not to mention travel to pick up)... seems a bit like a disease vector to me.</p></li><li><p>The Polish constitution has a very specific entry about delaying elections for up to 90 days during emergencies (<a href="https://www.senat.gov.pl/en/about-the-senate/konstytucja/chapter-xi/">https://www.senat.gov.pl/en/about-the-senate/konstytucja/chapter-xi/</a>), so why are they having it if not for political gain?</p></li></ul><p>It's clearly because Duda, like many leaders is surgingly popular<br /><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b1a6457c-7a5c-11ea-bd25-7fd923850377">https://www.ft.com/content/b1a6457c-7a5c-11ea-bd25-7fd923850377</a></p><p>Also people want it postponed (2/3rds for postponing) <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-poland-election/majority-of-poles-want-presidential-election-postponed-amid-coronavirus-survey-idUSKBN21C23T">https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-poland-election/majority-of-poles-want-presidential-election-postponed-amid-coronavirus-survey-idUSKBN21C23T</a></p><h2>Elections be dangerous in pandemics, who knew?</h2><p>The French had the brain wave of not cancelling the first round of their local elections (see France's 2 round system for everything). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_French_municipal_elections">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_French_municipal_elections</a></p><p>The second round has now been delayed until after the lockdown.

They've not had to rethink their voting system completely. I still think it's a terrible idea</p><p><strong>Postponed</strong><br />Macedonian<br />Serbia</p>
