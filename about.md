## **{{ site.title }} is a weekly podcast following news and politics across Europe.**

The show follows a relatively loose format discussing the weeks big events across Europe.

We also try to cover stories which have had less coverage in the English language press. A big motivation for starting the podcast was our annoyance at the skewed nature of mainstream press coverage of European events, including internal EU happenings. The 'but how does this relate to your country' nature of a lot of coverage makes sense; however we like to try see things from the perspective of the local population and Europe as a whole.

A software developer with a psychology degree during the day. The podcast serves as an outlet for my political and polls junkie tendencies. Political views tend to skew left on most issues but party affiliation is non-existant. Electoral reform is necessary in most countries in Europe and rarely gets the attention it deserves...

## **This Site**
The idea of this site is to supplement the podcast. We were generating a lot of content and having discussions which didn't make the podcast. We also often had ideas for interesting pieces of data to visualise. This serves as a place which brings together all the {{site.title}} content into one place.

- A feed combining
  - *The Podcast* - each episode will get a page on the site
  - *Written Content* - We'll occasionally add some additionally content in the style of blog posts, either expanding on topics we've covered on the cast or ones we weren't able to get to
  - *Data Content*

- A [Main Map](/main-map) showing some pieces of interesting data we keep updated
