## **{{ site.title }} is a podcast**

Europe is a sum of its parts and so it's important to understand what's going on in those parts. We cover cover the differing political landscape and state of "progressive" agendas across the continent.

The scope of the podcast is to cover events and causes relevant to a European "progressive" outlook. Basically is positive change happening, if not why? Especially for 2020 what can look like or is being portrayed as positive change may not actually be so positive.

We also try to cover topics which have had less or poor coverage in the English language press. A big motivation for starting the podcast was our annoyance at the skewed nature of mainstream press coverage of European events, including internal EU happenings. The ‘but how does this relate to your country’ nature of a lot of coverage makes sense; however, the perspective of the local population, how it related to progressive causes and Europe as a whole gets lost a lot of the time.

## **New Listener Starting Point**

We now do a yearly summary episode with up to date background information for what we plan to cover which can serve as an introduction to new listeners - [here](/2020/01/27/Subsequently-in-Europe-2020.html)

### [**Ciarán Dold**](https://twitter.com/CiaranDold)

A designer/comedian with a weird obsession with EU politics, political opinions range from centre-left social democracy to full anarcho-communism who wishes to destroy the state and capitalism (depending on blood sugar levels). I enforce the "No Election Left Behind" rule (you're welcome Liechtenstein) and the Eurovision definition of Europe (Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan! Israel and Australia is pushing it though). Generally believes in further EU integration that directly benefit individuals and while I'm not a massive Eurovision fan, I'm certainly an obnoxious Eurovision fan.

### [**Hugh O'Brien**](https://twitter.com/{{site.twitter_username}})
Software developer and PhD student in medical imaging. A psychology degree lives in my back pocket. Interests include misunderstandings of basic statistics in the media and complaining about what is and isn't valid news. Capital 'P' Pragmatism is generally a good plan, but it's not an excuse for not aiming for what would actually be good.
